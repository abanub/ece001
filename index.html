            Az computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a 
            computer performing some kind of computation or algorithm and possibly 
            control external devices such as printers, disk drives, robots, and so on. For example, PostScript
            programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer 
            printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on
            some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming  
            language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor 
            for that language. In most practical contexts, a programming language
            involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way.Programming languages  
            differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people,
            while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.

            Authors disagree on the precise definition, but traits often considered important requirements and objectives of the language to be characterized as a programming language:
            Function: A programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which instruct a computer to perform some kind of computation, and/or organize the flow of control
             between external devices (such as a printer, a robot, or any peripheral).
            Target: Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to
             communicate instructions to machines. In some cases, programming languages are used by one program or machine to program another; PostScript source code, for example, 
             is frequently generated programmatically to control a computer printer or display.
            Constructs: Programming languages may contain constructs for defining and manipulating data structures or for controlling the flow of execution.
            Expressive power: The theory of computation classifies languages by the computations they can express (see Chomsky hierarchy). All Turing complete languages can
             implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete yet often called programming languages.
            Non-computational languages, such as markup languages like HTML or formal grammars like BNF, are usually not considered programming languages. It is a usual approach
             to embed a programming language into the non-computational (host) language, to express templates for the host language.

            Python is a general purpose programming language currently ranked third on the TIOBE Index and 4th
            in-demand by Stackflow. Python plays a central role in developing AI and data analytics programs, 
            as well as developing deep learning and machine learning capabilities. This means that we expect
            demand to continue to rise as these technologies become more widespread.

        If you ask just about any programmer what one of the most popular and in-demand programming languages is, 
        they will probably tell you JavaScript. It is an essential tool for front-end web development. 
        Regardless of what issues you may have with JavaScript, it is hard to deny that it is a useful and a language 
        that is used a lot, so don’t expect to see it go anywhere anytime soon.

            Everywhere you look as a programmer, you will see C/C++ language being used.
            While it is one of the harder programming languages to learn, if you are a programmer
            that prefers working at the system-level, this is a language to learn as soon as possible!

            Designed by Microsoft, C# has many similarities to C++ and is used primarily to program native Windows applications;
            but it can be used for other platforms as well. It is also quite popular for building phone apps and Virtual Reality.
